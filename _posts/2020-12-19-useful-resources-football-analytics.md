Getting Started in Data Analytics, and especially Football Analytics might be a challenge for most of the people having an interest in the field. I have had a long standing passion for Football Analytics, and very recently - thanks to Lockdown - I have set up the foundations to kickstart my career in this field. I have to thank some of the amazing people involved in the Football Analytics community in twitter who constantly share resources that can help you learn stuff.

Before I get into the details, one thing all the people working in Football Analytics get asked is "How to get started in Football Analytics/Sports Analytics?". Who better than [Tom Worville](https://twitter.com/Worville) of [The Athletic](https://twitter.com/TheAthleticUK) to answer this question. Here is Tom with a short [thread](https://twitter.com/Worville/status/1275732993819250688?s=20) on how to get started in the game. This [article](https://brendankent.com/2020/12/16/languages-and-tools-to-learn-for-sports-analytics/) from [Brendan Kent](https://twitter.com/brendankent) - creator of the [@MeasurablesPod](https://twitter.com/MeasurablesPod) - cannot be missed.

[Nandy](https://twitter.com/nandy_sd) is one of the amazing people on the Analytics community in twitter and he constantly helps the community sharing some of his work. Very recently, he shared a huge database of all shots(~300k shots) available in understat. You can checkout the database [here](https://twitter.com/nandy_sd/status/1337388224457494528?s=20). Be kind and give him a follow too and of course start playing around with the shot maps.

When I first started working with shot data from understat, I came across this [tweet](https://twitter.com/biscuitchaser/status/1294608904647839744?s=20) by [Mark Wilkins/@biscuitcharer](https://twitter.com/biscuitchaser). In the tweet, Mark has shared the code to pull the data for all teams and players from understat. He has also written a very detailed article about this. You can read it [here](https://biscuitchaserfc.blogspot.com/2020/09/shot-data-for-top-5-european-leagues.html). I will also have to thank [Saints by Numbers](https://twitter.com/saintsbynumbers) for making a small [addition](https://twitter.com/saintsbynumbers/status/1294615248595488772?s=20) to Mark's code that pulls all shot data.

Possession Value and Expected Threat are some of the very recently evolved metrics. Before you actually start working with those, I think you must check out [this](https://www.statsperform.com/resource/introducing-a-possession-value-framework/#:~:text=Key%20takeaways,on%2Dthe%2Dball%20events) article from [StatsPerform](https://www.statsperform.com/) on Possession Value and [this](https://karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html) one on Expected Threat by [Karun Singh](https://twitter.com/karun1710). I have to tell you that I am still not comfortable creating PV visualizations and I am still learning how to use them. If you want to regularly see Possession Value related information and visualizations, you should follow [Omar/@topimpacat](https://twitter.com/topimpacat)'s account.

[Nandy](https://twitter.com/nandy_sd) also very recently posted about how to incorporte xT/PV into your passing data using R. You can find it [here](https://twitter.com/nandy_sd/status/1339871712205127680?s=20).

While reading articles or going through some football related tweets, some of the terms can be new to us and we might not know what some of the advanced metrics mean. So, If you want to know the definitions of various metrics, this [article](https://thefutebolist.wordpress.com/stat-glossary/) by Dundee United's Scout ([working remotely from India](https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/dundee-united-ashwin-raman-analysis-scout/)) - [Ashwin Raman](https://twitter.com/AshwinRaman_). [Ashwin](https://twitter.com/AshwinRaman_) has also contributed to another Glossary [article](https://footballstatsglossary.home.blog/) in collaboration with [Mark Thompson](https://twitter.com/EveryTeam_Mark).

Some of us prefer video content over written lengthy resources. If you are that kind you should probably check out [Friends of Tracking](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBFJYcag8j2rm_9HkrrA7w/videos) youtube channel. From how to get started on football analytics to how to make a name for yourself, they almost teach you everything. You can also checkout their github repository [here](https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD).


Each one of us have a league prefernce to do our analysis. I analyse mostly the Premier League and [@DrMukherjeeS](https://twitter.com/DrMukherjeeS) mostly posts amazing content about the Beligan league but if you ever wanna become a football scout/analyst, it is only fair that you know about players from different leagues. The top leagues are almost broadcasted in every country but most of us do not know where to watch some of the games of the lower leagues. This [thread](https://twitter.com/NinadB_06/status/1332377583925641216?s=20) by [Ninad](https://twitter.com/NinadB_06) is here to help you. Ninad also posts some amazing Tableau content in his twitter profile.
