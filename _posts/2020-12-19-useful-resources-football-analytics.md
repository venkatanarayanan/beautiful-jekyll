Getting Started in Data Analytics, and especially Football Analytics might be a challenge for most of the people having an interest in the field. I have had a long standing passion for Football Analytics, and very recently - thanks to Lockdown - I have set up the foundations to kickstart my career in this field. I have to thank some of the amazing people involved in the Football Analytics community in twitter who constantly share resources that can help you learn stuff.

Before I get into the details, one thing all the people working in Football Analytics get asked is "How to get started in Football Analytics/Sports Analytics?". Who better than [Tom Worville]() of [The Athletic] to answer this question. Here is Tom with a short thread on how to get started in the game. [This] article from [Brendan Kent]() cannot be missed.

[Nandy](https://twitter.com/nandy_sd) is one of the amazing people on the Analytics community in twitter and he constantly helps the community sharing some of his work. Very recently, he shared a huge database of all shots(~300k shots) available in understat. You can checkout the database [here](https://twitter.com/nandy_sd/status/1337388224457494528?s=20). Be kind and give him a follow too and of course start playing around with the shot maps.
