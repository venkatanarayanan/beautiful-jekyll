In this article I explain the different data visualizations I have created using R programming. I have mostly used R's ggplot package to create these visualizations.

The Bundesliga was the first big 5 european league to restart post lockdown and came to a close on 27th June, 2020. Bayern Munich won the league title for a record 8th successive year and finished 12 points above their closest challengers Borrusia Dortmund. The Champions also had the third youngest squad in terms of mean age.
