[Eric Laurie](https://twitter.com/EricLaurie), the Performance Analyst & Academy Coach at [Molde FK](https://twitter.com/Molde_FK), is one of the best analysts I have seen on twitter. He shares some of the best Manchester United related content too, which is why I like him even more(Haha!).

Eric [recently decided to](https://twitter.com/EricLaurie/status/1341350178993938433?s=20) share the definitions of various Analytics and Tactical terms that he uses in his posts. This is some amazing help for the community from Eric as most of us are still not aware of what some of the tactical terms mean. So I thought I will create one place which will contain all information related to this. I would like to Thank Eric for doing this and I am looking forward to more of his work.
