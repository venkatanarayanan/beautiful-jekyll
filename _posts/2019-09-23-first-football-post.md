This weekend’s big fixture is Chelsea vs Liverpool and I have looked at how good Liverpool are defensively away from home against top 6 opposition.

We all know how good Liverpool are at Anfield, even against “top 6” opposition, but how well they fare away from home against the “big 6” opposition

Klopp’s record against Chelsea in the Premier League
Played: 8
Won : 3
Drawn: 4
Lost : 1

Whereas under Rodgers, Liverpool have never won against Chelsea,

Played: 6
Won: 0

Drawn: 3

Liverpool, under Klopp, have won 23 points away to Chelsea, Arsenal, Man City, Man United & Spurs. Only Man City have won more points during this period.

However, in Klopp’s first 2 years, Liverpool never lost away to “top 6” opposition and  won 16/24 points, this number drastically reduced  and in his next two years, till date, Liverpool have won  7/30 points, winning only once against Tottenham in 18/19.

Liverpool signed Virgil Van dijk in Jan 2018. He made his debut on 23/01/2018 against Swansea, Of the 7 points that Liverpool won away to “top 6” in the last two seasons, 6 points were after signing Van Dijk. Between the start of 17/18 season and the date till Van Dijk made his debut, Liverpool conceded 12 goals in 3 games against Tottenham, City and Arsenal. Since Van Dijk’s debut Liverpool have conceded only 8 in 7 games. 

Liverpool’s best defensive performances away to the “top 6” have come in Klopp’s first two years, after that they have slowly started leaking goals, In fact they have kept only 2 clean sheets, under Klopp, away to “big 6”.

Liverpool have allowed 50 attempts at goal so far, more than the previous three seasons at this stage and Chelsea have had 83 attempts at goal so far, their highest ever tally at this stage of the league. 

Another point to note is that both Trent and Robertson did not have any attacking returns against Chelsea in the last 2 seasons.

With Chelsea’s attack in hot form, I will think twice if I am going to pick anyone from Liverpool’s defense(even if it’s TAA), because their clean sheet potential for this week is very bad, given that Chelsea have scored in every game but one in the last 10 meetings between these two. 

I will come up with an analysis of Liverpool’s offensive numbers away to “big 6” opposition in the coming days.
