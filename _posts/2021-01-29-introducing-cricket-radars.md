I always get asked if I create any visualizations using cricket data just like I create football visualizations. My answer so far has been no but however it is something I have wanted to do for a long time and am planning to create more cricket visualizations in 2021.

Radar charts (Polar charts) are very common in Football Analytics. They are almost the go-to charts if you to want show the overall profile of a player. [Football Slices](https://twitter.com/FootballSlices) - created by Ham(https://twitter.com/DyslexicDdue), sliced(insert any word of your choice for suspended) off late, very famously used Radar charts to show the profile of a player. I have created my own Radar charts as well for some football players - some of which you can view in my twitter profile [Venkatanarayanan](https://twitter.com/VenkyReddevil).

So let's come to the purpose of this article. Have you seen somebody create a Radar chart for a cricket player? If so, would appreicate if you could share the links with me. I have not and that is why I decided to create a Radar chart to understand the profile of a cricket player. This idea has been in my mind for sometime now but I was still working out how to setup the foundations to develop this in the future. Now that I have come up with something, the next step is to better the choice of metrics used in the viz.
